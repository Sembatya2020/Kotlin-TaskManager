# Overview

This project is a console-based Task Manager application written in Kotlin. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in the Kotlin language, including its syntax, object-oriented features, and collection handling. The app allows users to add, list, and remove tasks interactively.

The purpose of writing this software is to further my learning as a software engineer, specifically in Kotlin, and to explore its features compared to Java. This project showcases the use of data classes, mutable and immutable variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and collections.
